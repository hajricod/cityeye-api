            📂 Evidence handling: upload images/text, track history, manage permissions

            💬 Case commenting: secure collaboration among assigned users

            📢 Public safety alerts: email notifications to residents

            📄 API documentation: auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI support

            🧪 Soft & hard delete auditing, rate limiting, long polling support

            📈 Text analysis & link extraction for evidence and case descriptions
